/**
 * CLHLock records each threadâ€™s status in a QNode object which has a boolean locked
 * field. If locked is true, then the corresponding thread has either acquired the
 * lock or is waiting for the lock, and if false, the thread has released the lock.
 *
 * Each thread refers to its predecessor through a ThreadLocaL<QNode> predecessor
 * variable. This effectively creates a virtual (or implicit) linked list of QNode
 * objects
 *
 * When a thread attempts to acquire a lock, it spins on its predecessor node waiting
 * for the locked field to become false.
