/**
 * A nonblocking lock-free queue implemented as a linked list of nodes. If the
 * queue is not empty, a node represents either an item waiting to be dequeued,
 * or a reservation waiting to be fulfilled. A nodeâ€™s type field indicates which.
 *
 *  Reservations (or placeholders) from a dequeuer work as follows: a dequeuer puts
 *  a reservation (placeholder) object in the queue (a node whose item is null),
 *  indicating that the dequeuer is waiting for an enqueuer to fill the placeholder
 *  with an item so that both enqueuer and dequeuer can rendezvous with each other.
 *  The dequeuer then spins on a flag in the  reservation. Later, when this enqueuer
 *  discovers the reservation, it fulfills the reservation by depositing an item
 *  in the placeholder and notifying the dequeuer by setting the reservation's flag
 *
 * At any one time, all existing queue nodes have the same type: either the queue
 * consists entirely of items waiting to be dequeued, or entirely of reservations
 * waiting to be  fulfilled.
